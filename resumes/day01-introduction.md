# Day 1 - Introduction

- A **Computer Network** is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources.

- **Client**: Device that accesses a service made available by a server.
- **Server**: Device that provides functions or services for clients.

- **Switches**:
    - have **many network interfaces/ports** for end hosts to connect to (usually 24+)
    - provide **connectivity** to hosts **within the same LAN** (Local Area Network)

- **Routers**:
    - have **fewer network interfaces** than switches.
    - are used to provide **connectivity between LANs**.
    - used to **send data over the internet**.

## **Firewall**:
- **monitor and control** network **traffic** based on configured rules.
- can be places **inside** the network or **outside the network**
    - the firewall can filter trrafic  before it reaches the router or after it passes through the router.
- **Next-Generation Firewalls**: when they include more modern and advanced filtering capabilities (Cisco ASA5500-X, Firepower 2100, etc.)

### Network Firewalls
**Network Firewalls** are hardware devices that filter traffic between the networks.

### Host-Based Firewalls
**Host-Based Firewalls** are software applications that filter traffic entering and exiting a host machine, like a pc.
